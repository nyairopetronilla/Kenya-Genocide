        <h1>Kenya</h1>
        <p>It is a vibrant East African nation, thriving on its rich agricultural output—coffee, tea, and horticultural products—while also drawing tourists with its stunning wildlife, national parks, and warm, welcoming people.</p>

        <p>During British colonization, Kenyans suffered a brutal genocide. Forced displacement from ancestral lands, concentration camps, and violence targeted individuals based on ethnicity and political affiliations.</p>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Kikuyu genocide took place in the 1950s, a decade after the Holocaust and the West’s promise to never again allow the destruction of entire peoples, and it saw virtually the entire population of 1.5 million Kikuyu locked up in concentration camps, where they were starved, beaten, and tortured to death by the tens of thousands.</p>
        <p>Kenya is listed in the Genocidal Watch as the following:</p>
        <p><strong>Targeted Groups:</strong> Nomadic pastoralists (Somalis and Maasai), Hunter-gatherers, Muslims, and other minorities and indigenous groups.</p>
        <p><strong>Perpetrators:</strong> Government and state security forces.</p>
        <p><strong>Alert Status:</strong> Watch</p>
        <p><strong>Genocide Stage(s):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stage 3: Discrimination (At this stage, groups are excluded from participating in civil society. Discriminatory practices, such as denying voting rights or restricting access to certain places, create divisions between “us” and “them.”)</li>
            <li>Stage 6: Polarization (Propaganda is used to further polarize society, creating distance between different groups. This stage aims to exclude and isolate targeted groups, making it easier to perpetrate violence or discrimination against them.)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2007 Election Violence</h2>
        <p>After the 2007 election violence, Kenya committed to R2P (Responsibility to Protect) principles. International intervention helped mitigate the crisis, setting an example of diplomatic action.</p>

        <h3>R2P Pillars and Kenya</h3>
        <p>R2P is based on three pillars:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The state has a responsibility to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.</li>
            <li>The international community has a responsibility to assist states in fulfilling this responsibility.</li>
            <li>If a state fails to protect its citizens, the international community must be prepared to take appropriate collective action, in a timely and decisive manner, in accordance with the UN Charter.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Kenya's commitment to these principles after the 2007 election violence highlights its efforts to prevent future atrocities and maintain peace.</p>

        <h2>Current Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>Kenya faces risks due to tribal tensions and its young population. The <a href="https://thesentinelproject.org/">Sentinel Project</a> assesses vulnerability and recommends preventive measures.</p>
